# Welcome to bapp

Short for bookmarking application. This program provides a way to a user to store their bookmarks efficiently 
using a command line interface.

## Motivation

I seek to understand how to build software applications leveraging on the idea of separation of concerns.
The app will have the following layers:
- Presentation layer
  Where user sees and chooses options
- Business logic layer 
  Where Options trigger specific commands
- Persistence layer
  Where data is persisted for later use.
